# PyDEILabs

## Usage
To use the script chose between the default or noconfig version. 
The default version uses a configuration file, located in the /config folder to obtain the required parameters to login.
The noconfig version contains these values at the top of the script.

Fill these values with your information and launch the script from the terminal with the "in" parameter.
If everything works you will see the "Successfully entered lab" message.
